can use whatever language we want

up to our code to make sure can recover UDP packets (lost, out of order)

file exchange over server
part 1: assume no problems
part 2: intentionally introduce erros into network, 
        and make part 1 still work with errors

trivial solution: only ever send 1 packet at a time...
    packets can't get out of order
^ sacrifices efficiency
^ disallowed

should be doing:

X1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
   [        ]
have a window
send first 5 packets of window
wait for aknowledgements (get 1, move window to include 6)
    (get 3, don't move window yet)
good solution if don't get a response: set a timer
    after a certain time, send a new copy
can use packet numbers, if assume packets are same size

sudo mn -x

h1 ping h2

on switch window:
    tc qdisc add dev <dev> root netem loss <X.Y%> 
    tc qdisc add dev s1-eth1 root netem loss 50%

these commands only work on outgoing packets, not ingoing
if do both "dev s1-eth1" and "dev s1-eth2", then both directions
